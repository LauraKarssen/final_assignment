Final Assignment for CTH 2016

Vivien: I added a very fancy text editor called ckeditor which has replaced our old boring textbox. From now on, it isn't just any text editor, it's een ADVANCED text editor.
	In the process of installing it however, I seem to have broken the word count button (sorry). I haven't been able to get it to work again, but I'll keep trying.
	
	The webpage looks like this right now:

I still want to add some sort of visual process tracker, I'll try to look into it this weekend!
